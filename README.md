# LRM-1.1 - Loss Reservation Analysis using Machine Learning Models
This is a model made in XGboost in R to analyze, assess, and predict loss reserve data.
I directly compared the XGBoost, Random Forest and ARIMA models for loss reserving. These models are evaluated based on their predictive accuracy, stability and computational efficiency.
